Concept or Theme:<br>
During the pandemic many people are affected by covid-19 and gone through a serious situations due to lack of proper treatment. Some reports says that 40-45 percentage of patients died due to oxygen crises and improper treatment. I had seen many people were suffering to get hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. Most of the patients realtives who needs oxygen and there is insufficient oxygen in the hospital used to post a post on social media plaforms and used to wait for the reply. Sadly there were many fraudsters who tries to make cash over the situation by increasing the oxygen prices and creating shortage of hospital beds availability and charging high prices for alloting bed to the patients. The fact is not many hospitals has created these problems but the mediators between hospitals and public had done these inhumane things.<br>
So our group idea was to abolish such those fradusters and to create a website as a chain between patients, hospitals, authorised oxygen dealers. The government should maintain the similar website so that the people can get adequate imformation and they can escape from such fraudsters. In this website the patients can see the geniune hospitals that are following the government guidelines regarding the infrastructure and amount for treatment , the geniune oxygen dealers and emergency contact numbers.
For every hospital their toll-free numbers, link to their official website and navigation to the hospital. Also were many other things like covid vaccination details and saftey measures and guidelines<br>
This website is still in developing phase we want to provide so more features in coming days like the users can see the no.of beds availability in hospital and can book their bed by paying a fixed amount in online instead of conforming by call. This website works fine on all devices: mobiles,pc,tablets etc
